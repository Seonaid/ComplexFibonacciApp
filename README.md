This application is a practice deployment of Docker with an (unneccesarily complex) 
architecture.

It follows Stephen Grider's course at Udemy:
https://www.udemy.com/docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide/

Consists of:
A React front end (client)
An Express server that routes requests
Worker that computes fibonacci numbers (using the naive recursive method so that it is deliberately computationally intense to mock up more challenging back end processes)
